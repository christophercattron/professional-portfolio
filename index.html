            <p>
                With the COVID-19 pandemic, we are certainly living in unique times. After graduating with my M.S. in Civil Engineering in December 2019, 
                I applied and was accepted to my dream graduate program: the <a href="http://msc-sahc.org/" target="_blank"> SAHC Advanced Masters in Structural Analysis of Monuments and Historical 
                    Constructions</a>—an advanced education program on the engineering of conservation of structures, with a focus on architectural heritage and 
                buildings with cultural value. In September 2020, I was to begin coursework at the University of Minho in Portugal, after which I would 
                complete a dissertation at the University of Padua in Italy. Unfortunately, due to circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, I had 
                to defer my enrollment to fall 2021. Between now and then, I am seeking a coop, internship, or temporary employment as a civil/structural engineer.

                        I was born and grew up in Saint Charles, Missouri, just 25 miles west of Saint Louis. I have a thoughtful, caring, 
                        intelligent, and sassy Russian wife named Maria, and together we have a mischievous cat named Daisy. In my spare time I have been learning HTML/CSS and JavaScript 
                        to gain computer and programming skills and understanding that I can apply in my professional career.

                    <h2 class="w3-center">MY LOGO</h2>
                    <h4 class="w3-center"><em>You may have seen a blue “CC” logo in a few places on this website. Here’s a little more about
                         the meaning behind the design.</em></h4>
                    <p>
                        The ‘CC’ in the logo is in the shape of a keystone—one of the most important components of a voussoir arch. 
                        I chose the keystone shape due to my interest in historic structures. I’ve always daydreamed about being an 
                        archaeologist and discovering some missing artifact or remnant of an ancient civilization. I strongly believe 
                        in the value of human art, history, and heritage. Due to my strengths in science, engineering, and mathematics 
                        rather than history and the humanities, I chose to pursue a degree in civil engineering rather than archaeology. 
                        However, while job searching during my senior year at university, I began to wonder if there were archaeology jobs 
                        for civil engineers. After reading an 
                        <a href="https://archive.archaeology.org/0905/etc/conversation.html" target="_blank">article</a> about John Ochsendorf, 
                        an engineer and professor at MIT whose work is heavily focused on the mechanics and behavior of historical structures,
                        my career and professional goals quickly shifted. Now, nearly three years later, I have been accepted to the 
                        <a href="http://msc-sahc.org/" target="_blank">SAHC Advanced Masters program</a>, and am looking forward to 
                        future oppotunities and adventures as I pursue a career in the preservation of historic monuments and constructions.

                            <li>I completed design work for nearly 30 pre-fabricated steel and aluminum buildings 
                                including guard booths, equipment enclosures, and portable offices for Porta-King Building Systems and Starrco. 
                                Design work included estimating loads, reviewing drawings, producing construction documents, and checking 
                                structural adequacy of members for gravity, wind, seismic, and snow loads based on project location.

                                The 2015 edition of the ADM introduced significant changes to provisions regarding the flexural strength for 
                                yield, rupture, local buckling, and lateral-torsional buckling as well as changes to the buckling strength 
                                of axial compression members. I was responsible for editing Larson’s MathCAD templates to ensure their 
                                compatibility with the new provisions. I became very familiar with the ADM specification and the basic design 
                                concepts of curtain wall members while completing this task. Being immersed in the code gave me a deeper 
                                understanding of concepts such as shear center and various types of buckling that can occur in slender elements.

                                While working on the Twelve24 canopy fins, I learned how to design for an eccentrically loaded group of bolts 
                                using the 2010 AISC Specification for Structural Steel Buildings (AISC Steel Manual 14th Edition). I also 
                                learned how to apply the wind load provisions for a parapet using ASCE 7-10.

                            My internship with Larson Engineering was my first “real-world” experience with structural analysis and design. 
                            The engineers at Larson were excellent mentors, quickly teaching me their process for producing structural calculations, 
                            walking me through important design concepts, and the ins-and-outs of the design aids they use (including the 
                            software MathCAD and RISA-3D). 
                            <br><br>
                            Though most of my time was spent in the office, I did get to join a site visit to an elementary school to shadow
                             an engineer examining a structural deficiency discovered during roof maintenance. It was during this internship 
                             that I developed my love for the under desk treadmill, which I used daily while at Larson—I later purchased an
                              under desk treadmill for personal use when I began working from home at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

                    <p>Great Rivers Greenway (GRG) is a regional trail and parks district in the St. Louis area whose mission is to make the region
                        a more vibrant place to live, work and play by developing and maintaining a network 
                        of <a href=“https://greatriversgreenway.org/what-is-a-greenway” target=“_blank”>greenways</a>.
                        With over 128 miles of trails (and counting), it is obvious that they have plenty of bridges 
                        to care for. Following the failure of a boardwalk due to a crossing emergency vehicle in August 2016, GRG set out to put together
                        a plan of regular inspections and maintenance of bridges on their greenways. Collecting data, photos, and documents for these 
                        bridges was my job for the summer.

                            <h6><em>Field data collection</em></h6>
                            <li>I was given an iPad with a cellular data package and was directed to visit each bridge that was shown on the GIS. 
                                With my 2015 Giant Cypress bicycle secured to the bike rack on my ‘04 Mazda 6, I set out to collect as much data 
                                as possible. After cycling to each bridge location I began my general procedure for collecting data: (1) take photographs 
                                of bridge from several angles; (2) measure spatial dimensions using a 25’ steel tape (or surveyor's wheel); (3) note bridge 
                                characteristics; (4) record other observations including a description of the surrounding vegetation and comments about the 
                                condition of the bridge.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <h6><em>Bridge documentation</em></h6>
                            <li>Back at the office, I collected relevant engineering documents for each bridge as well. These documents included project 
                                plan sets, specifications, shop drawings, inspection reports, and structural calculations. I secured as many documents as 
                                possible primarily by searching through project folders on the projects drive on GRG’s servers, looking through hard copies 
                                of project documents on file in the GRG office basement, and reaching out to the manufacturers of bridges that had serial numbers.

                            <br>
                            <h6><em>GIS Bridge layer</em></h6>
                            <li>In conjunction with the GIS team at Horner & Shifrin,the bridge layer in the GIS was modified to better organize available data. 
                                The data was organized similar to the Federal Highway Administration’s National Bridge Database while being modified for use 
                                in pedestrian and bicycle trail applications.

                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p>The data I collected and the organizational framework I put in place has since been further developed and used to create a plan for regular 
                            inspection of GRG’s bridges. You can view GRG’s GIS asset inventory <a href="https://gisapps.civildesigninc.com/GRG" target="_blank">here<a>.

                            It’s worth adding that my entire summer wasn’t spent scouring the greenways by myself or searching through decades-old files in a basement—the 
                            team at GRG also gave me several opportunities to sit in on construction meetings, join engineering inspections, and network with engineers. 
                            One of these experiences is when I got to join a small team of structural engineers from Horner & Shifrin (H&S) who were investigating 
                            section loss of steel girders on the 1920s-era Chain of Rocks Bridge. I am very appreciative of the engineers from H&S for letting me join 
                            and answering my many questions.
                            <br><br>
                            Even though my work with GRG was not directly practicing engineering per se, it nonetheless demonstrates my investigative nature,
                            thoroughness, attention to detail, strengths in communication, and ability to successfully work independently. I learned a lot about 
                            bridges and became familiar with engineering drawings, specifications, and documentation. My experience with GRG was a great one. I got 
                            to spend the summer doing things I love (cycling, exploring, learning about engineering) while contributing to a cause I am passionate about 
                            (connecting communities, strengthening social, economic, and environmental well-being).

                        to have me join their summer internship team. As the employers were taking down their displays and packing up to leave, I gave
                        one last attempt at speaking with a recruiter: I approached the booth for the design-build concrete contractor, Concrete
                        Strategies (CSI). My enthusiasm and motivation impressed the CSI recruiters.

                            <p>After speaking with the CSI recruiters, I was invited to their spring break “externship” program. This program was a 
                                two-day experience that involved learning about the company, the construction contracting industry, tilt-up concrete 
                                construction, and what a career as an engineer with a firm like CSI can look like. There were lecture-style sessions, 
                                group team-builder activities, and site visits to observe construction practices and learn more about what goes on in 
                                the field. I asked a lot of questions, received a lot of answers, and got to network with engineering professionals 
                                and other student “externs”.

                                President’s office to ask if he had any summer internships still available. To my surprise, he said yes, and issued 
                                a soft job offer on-the-spot. I learned a lot about construction contracting from this experience, but I think even 
                                more importantly, I learned the value of persistence in pursuing your goals, and the opportunities that can come 
                                simply by being an interested and motivated learner. 
                            </p>
                            <h6><em>Summer Internship</em></h6>
                            <p>This internship was my first real-world engineering experience. I was designated as the Project Engineer 
                                for the St. Charles Annual Concrete Repair 2015 project. This project included the removal and replacement of concrete roads
                                 and sidewalks and upgrades to handicap-accessible ramps to ensure the meeting of ADA guidelines in two St. Charles City 
                                 subdivisions. The project gave me exposure to construction specifications, documents, scheduling, and working with laborers 
                                 and subcontractors. I was responsible for creating the project schedule, tracking demolition and construction progress,
                                 and working with the subcontractors to make sure work was complete correctly and on-time. With the project taking place in
                                  a residential area, another important part of my job was to serve as a liaison between CSI, the city, and the public.
                            </p>
                            <p>At the office, I worked with the Project Manager to detail project objectives and timeline, 
                                coordinate field work scheduling, material acquisition, and project cost tracking. Using satellite imagery, I mapped
                                 out the slabs that needed to be replaced, and used a color coded map to track project progress and communicate with 
                                 the PM, sub-contractors, and laborers. 
                            </p>
                            <p>In the field, I ensured that adequate and correct equipment and the needed materials were
                                 ready on site, tracked the daily amount of removal, grading, and pouring that occurred, and kept in close contact 
                                 with subdivision residents, the City Inspector, and the Subdivision Trustee to keep them updated with project 
                                 scheduling, field questions, and hear out any concerns.
                            </p>
                            <p>In addition to my work on the concrete restoration project, I got to participate in lunch and
                                 learn sessions throughout the summer, learning about topics such as the design-build project delivery method
                                  (and how it differs from other methods such as the traditional design-bid-build),  among other topics. I also 
                                  participated in Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) training and got to join for site visits 
                                  to diverse projects including tilt-up and mid-rise concrete pours.

                    <p>Just before fall training and freshman move-in at the beginning of the Fall 2019 semester at Missouri S&T,
                        the Resident Housing Director at the Thomas Jefferson residence hall (TJ Hall / TJ) stepped down from 
                        their position. This left a residential housing complex with nearly 700 residents and over 20 student-staff
                        members without a permanent housing professional at the helm. Given my extensive involvement in Residential
                        Life during my time as an undergraduate student at Missouri S&T, I was considered for and ultimately hired 
                        to fill the vacancy. What ensued from then on was a unique and incredibly rewarding experience.

                            <li>I became the Resident Director (RD) of TJ Hall in September 2019, shortly after the new Resident Assistant (RA) 
                                staff were trained and began tending to their unique, blossoming communities amongst the 15 floors housing students 
                                in TJ. Along with my wife and cat, I moved from my apartment just outside of town to the RD apartment in TJ. It was 
                                quite an interesting experience to be moving back into the residence halls over a year after graduating, getting married, 
                                and moving into an apartment!
                                <br><br>
                                This job involved leading a staff of student leaders while meeting with students of concern, managing student conduct 
                                cases, advising hall government, and responding to crisis situations. I co-led the staff of RAs along with my co-supervisor, 
                                the Head Resident, a senior student studying Psychology with the long term goal of working as a Resident Director. 
                                We used one-on-one meetings, weekly staff meetings, monthly community assessments, regular evaluations, and other strategies
                                to lead the RAs and implement the department’s residential curriculum.

                            <h6><em>The TJURASSIC Challenge</em></h6>
                            <li>The staff took on the name TJurassic Park (a play on words of the film title <em>Jurassic Park</em>) after a group of RAs created a 
                                dinosaur-themed bulletin board in the main hallway toward the beginning of the school year. Near the beginning of the spring 2020
                                semester, my co-supervisor and I noticed that our RAs (and subsequently, their communities) were struggling to prioritize their
                                mental and physical well-being while balancing their jobs, academics, and other responsibilities as students. In response to
                                this, I came up with the idea for the Thomas Jefferson Ultimate Resident Assistant Super Self-Care and Improvement Challenge
                                (<em>TJURASSIC Challenge</em>). This was a fun way of getting student-staff thinking about and motivated to find and practice 
                                new ways to manage stress and take care of their mental, physical, and academic well-being. The goal of the incentive program 
                                was not to compete with others, but to strive for personal improvement.
                                <br><br>
                                Staff members were awarded points for practicing self-care—a list of nearly 30 activities was drafted as a guideline for ways
                                 to earn points. Points (which were self-tracked and self-reported) were awarded for activities such as getting recommended 
                                 hours of sleep, practicing a meditation or awareness exercise, utilizing an on-campus wellness resource, making healthy meal 
                                 choices, and even calling up a friend or loved one to catch up. Unique and fun prizes were awarded when individuals reached 
                                 certain point milestones, and the team as a whole received a group prize when they reached a collective benchmark. 
                                <br><br>
                                The strategy was effective at encouraging student-staff to be more intentional in identifying and implementing techniques to 
                                practice self-care. Many student-staff reported that they had tried new strategies to practice self-care. Student-staff also 
                                reported that they had encouraged (or been encouraged by) other staff members to implement the self-care strategies outlined
                                in the TJURASSIC Challenge. Student-staff reported positive outcomes: feeling better physically, feeling happier, and feeling
                                less stressed-out. You can read more about the TJURASSIC Challenge from an excerpt of the 2019-2020 TJ Assessment Summary report

                                Once the COVID-19 pandemic began spreading in the United States, it introduced unprecedented challenges to institutions of 
                                higher education, including Residential Life. After a few weeks of daily impromptu and emergency meetings (one of these late 
                                night meetings is shown in the slideshow above), the university and department made a series of decisions that ultimately led
                                to a nearly 90% reduction in the number of students living in the residence halls. The RA staff shrunk to a handful of students,
                                and by mid-April, TJ hall was vacant excepting me, my wife, and our cat. 
                                <br><br>
                                With several hundred less residents living in the building, my focus shifted to begin planning for the subsequent academic year. 
                                I was paired with another Residential Life professional and directed to research two topics as a part of the annual process of 
                                refining our residential curriculum to keep up with the latest research-based “best practices”. I conducted a literature review 
                                to examine current trends in retention and persistence and strategies to increase positive outcomes. I also researched strategies 
                                for conducting experiential learning virtually or in a socially distanced manner. I prepared an annotated bibliography, presented
                                the findings of my review, and indicated recommendations moving forward as the rest of the ResLife team continued to develop 
                                plans over the summer following my departure (laid off due to COVID-19).

                            in TJ. The award honors the person who has done the most for TJ Hall and who best represents not just TJHA, but TJ as a whole. 
                            I gladly accepted the award at a Zoom awards ceremony from the comfort of a rolling chair in my apartment.

                            The most fulfilling positions I have held in life were ones in service of others—in positions of mentorship, leadership, teambuilding,
                            and creating community to bring people together. My experience as RD for TJ Hall embodied this sentiment well. My passion for assisting
                            and connecting with students sometimes makes me reflect on the possibility of returning to work in higher education later in life 
                            either as faculty or staff (preferably as a professor).

                            The Community Partnership Resale Shop is a local, not-for-profit thrift store. All of the resale shop proceeds 
                            go to supporting The Community Partnership (TCP)—a local non-profit organization dedicated to serving children,
                             youth, and families in Phelps County and surrounding areas through a variety of programs in the areas of foster
                              care, pregnant and parenting youth, childhood disability, and early education. In 2018, TCP began receiving
                               grant funding from The Ozark Rivers Solid Waste Management District (ORSWMD) to add a staff management position to 
                               oversee textile recycling at their thrift store.

                                As Recycling Coordinator (RC), I implemented numerous strategies with the ultimate goal of diverting 
                                as much textile waste as possible from the landfill. To reduce textile waste, I sought to increase 
                                the amount of salvage clothing from the overall donation stream, as well as to increase the sale 
                                of clothing; this reduced the likelihood that clothing would ruin before it could be sold or salvaged.
                                These objectives were met by increasing volunteer recruitment, community awareness, and spending 
                                time sorting, processing, and managing the flow of textiles throughout the shop.

                                <h6><em>Salvage baling</em></h6>
                                <li>The primary way TCP reduces textile waste is through the salvage baling program. When sorting 
                                    through clothes and linens at the resale shop, whatever cannot be sold in store will become 
                                    salvage. Salvage is placed in trash bags at the resale shop, and the bags of salvage are stored
                                    in the back of the shop until a bale event. A bale event occurs when a volunteer group comes
                                    in at a scheduled date and time to help move the bags of salvage onto a box truck, unload 
                                    the bags at a local workshop, and produce the bales using the baler on-site. After the bales 
                                    are produced, they are stored until they can be sold to a company that specializes in 
                                    <a href="./resources/docs/The Life Cycle of Secondhand Clothing.pdf" target="_blank">reselling 
                                    and re-purposing used textiles</a>. This results in nearly 100% of salvaged 
                                    textiles being diverted from the landfill. Each bale weighs between 900 and 1300 pounds.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <h6><em>Volunteer recruitment</em></h6>
                                <li>Volunteers play a very important role at TCP Resale Shop, especially in the sorting, tagging, 
                                    hanging, distribution, and salvaging of textile donations. As a part of the ORSWMD grant, I 
                                    worked to recruit, train, and retain volunteers and volunteer groups to assist in the processing 
                                    of textiles for sale and salvage. I began outreach efforts by compiling a list of over 100 
                                    organizations that included university organizations, civic groups, businesses, and religious 
                                    groups; volunteer recruitment emails were then sent to these groups. The outreach was 
                                    successful—numerous groups, returning volunteers, and new volunteers began scheduling 
                                    volunteer events. Nearly every weekend following this outreach effort, I was training
                                    volunteer groups that were working in the shop and increasing the flow of clothing and
                                    other textiles to the sales floor. These recruitment efforts also assured that reliable 
                                    teams would be available to help with salvage bale events. 
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <h6><em>Community awareness</em></h6>
                                <li>I sought to increase community awareness of resale shop recycling efforts through social media 
                                    outreach, educating volunteers, and sharing information with customers and donors. I sought to 
                                    increase visibility of the resale shop’s salvage baling program as well as express the need for 
                                    and appreciation of volunteers. As such, I regularly posted on TCP Resale Shop’s Facebook page, 
                                    where over 6000 followers were able to see the messaging that often include pictures of volunteers 
                                    and bale events, thank-yous to volunteers, donors, and customers, and information about the salvage 
                                    baling program. In the shop, I educated every volunteer about the life-cycle of textiles in the 
                                    resale shop, including how the clothing is recycled. I explained to donors and customers that all 
                                    clothing donations are either sold to customers, or baled and sold to a company that recycles or 
                                    repurposes nearly 100% of the cloth. Customers and donors often expressed support and gratitude 
                                    regarding TCP’s stewardship of donations and dedication to recycling efforts.
                                    
    
                                </li>

                                <h6><em>The clothing donation stream</em></h6>
                                <li>In prior years, clothing could go months without being processed. This led to clothing having 
                                    to be thrown away. With the addition of the RC, more time was being spent on the sorting, processing, 
                                    and managing of clothing, ensuring donations did not end up in the trash. Not less than half of my 
                                    time on the job was spent sorting clothing and preparing the clothing for tagging, hanging, and 
                                    distribution to the sales floor. I was trained to “sort”, which is the term used to describe the 
                                    process of determining which clothing articles are “saleable”, and what clothing should be salvaged. 
                                    I relied on volunteers to get sorted clothing tagged, hung, and distributed to the correct fixtures 
                                    on the sales floor. The 2018 grant also included $1000 allocated to the purchase of shelving or 
                                    storage for textiles. Under the direction of the Resale Shop Director, I developed a proposal that 
                                    included the purchase of two new structures to contain off-season clothing, a new shelving unit and 
                                    storage bins for the storing of linens, and two rolling racks to replace older, poorly functioning ones.
    
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                During my time at the shop, I oversaw hundreds of hours of volunteer work, prepared dozens of tons of clothing
                                 for resale or salvage, and assisted with the baling of over 35 tons of clothing that was diverted from the 
                                 landfill to be resold, recycled, or repurposed. Clothing sales in-shop diverted an additional estimated 6.5 
                                 tons from the landfill. Since I was the first person in the RC position (and there was a change in Resale 
                                 Shop management occurring near the same time as my departure from the position) I typed up a detailed 
                                 transition document for the next and following Recycling Coordinators. <!--A modified version of this document

        <img title="While defending one of his geological theories, J. Harlen Bretz famously said 'Ideas 
        without precedent are generally looked upon with disfavor and men are shocked if their conceptions of an 
        orderly world challenged.' His work in the geomorpholgy of limestone caves was important in the development
        of our understanding of cave formations. His 1956 'Caves of Missouri' catalogs many of my home state's wild caves. 
        I've explored several of the caves he writes about, and it is always interesting to read his descriptions and 
        explainations of how certain formations developed."

        appreciable amount of depth where others strive for simplicity. This text picks up where most mechanics of
        materials leave off, and dives broadly into more advanced concepts. Though it is chocked-full of content, so far 
        I have only referenced the sections on inelastic material behavior, shear centers, stress concentrations, and fracture mechanics."
